# Go-to-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

PromoCode.dev will launch with a developer-first approach targeting indie developers and small development teams who struggle with manual promo code distribution. Our research shows this is an underserved market with existing solutions either too complex (enterprise-focused) or too limited (basic generators).

**Primary launch strategy:** Direct outreach to indie developer communities + content marketing focused on app launch best practices.

## Target Market Analysis

### Primary Target: Indie Developers & Small Teams
- **Size:** 50,000+ active indie developers launching iOS/Android apps annually
- **Pain point:** Manually managing promo codes via spreadsheets, emails, and screenshots
- **Budget:** $0-500/month for marketing tools
- **Decision makers:** Solo developers or technical co-founders

### Secondary Target: Marketing Agencies
- **Size:** 2,000+ agencies managing app launches for clients
- **Pain point:** Inefficient promo code workflows eating billable hours
- **Budget:** $500-2000/month for client management tools
- **Decision makers:** Account managers and project leads

### Market Validation Data
- 38% of developers use generative AI daily (showing tech adoption willingness)
- 136 billion app downloads in 2024 (massive promo code volume potential)
- $179/month starting price for existing solutions like Voucherify (opportunity for simpler pricing)

## Positioning Strategy

### Core Value Proposition
"The simplest way to distribute promo codes for app launches. Upload once, share automatically, track everything."

### Differentiation vs Competitors
- **vs Voucherify:** We're app-specific, not general e-commerce
- **vs Manual methods:** Automated distribution + real-time tracking
- **vs Enterprise solutions:** No-code setup, pay-per-use pricing

### Key Messaging Framework
1. **Save Time:** "Stop managing promo codes in spreadsheets"
2. **Reduce Errors:** "Never send expired or duplicate codes again"  
3. **Track Everything:** "Know exactly which codes work and which don't"
4. **Developer-Friendly:** "Built by developers, for developers"

## Pricing Strategy

### Freemium Model (Recommended)
