# Interview Update Prompt

## Based on Research: Time to Pivot or Double Down?

The research reveals a **crowded but fragmented market** with existing solutions focused on retail/ecommerce rather than app developers. Here's what you need to validate immediately.

## Key Research Findings

**The Competition Landscape:**
- Voucherify ($179/month), Talon.One (enterprise), and 10+ other platforms already exist
- BUT: They're all targeting retail/ecommerce, not app developers
- Apple's promo code system is limited (100 codes per app version) and clunky
- Developers are building custom redemption systems (potentially violating Apple guidelines)

**Market Size Reality Check:**
- Low-code platforms: $30.8B in 2024, 26.1% CAGR
- AI code tools: $7.37B in 2025, growing to $23.97B by 2030
- BUT: No specific data on promo code distribution market size

**Developer Pain Points Confirmed:**
- Apple's system: Manual, limited, expires in 28 days
- Current workarounds: Spreadsheets, manual tracking, potential guideline violations
- Dev Promo Kit exists but only manages Apple's existing system

## Critical Questions for Your Next Interviews

### 1. Platform Validation (Most Important)
**Ask:** "When you launch an app, which platforms do you distribute promo codes for?"
- If just iOS: Your multi-platform advantage disappears
- If multiple platforms: Strong value proposition confirmed
- **Follow-up:** "How do you currently handle codes for Android, Steam, web apps?"

### 2. Volume Reality Check
**Ask:** "How many promo codes do you typically need for a launch?"
- If under 100: Apple's system might be sufficient
- If 100+: Clear pain point
- **Follow-up:** "Do you ever run out mid-campaign? What happens then?"

### 3. Willingness to Pay
**Ask:** "If a service saved you 2 hours per launch and prevented code mix-ups, what would you pay monthly?"
- Compare against Voucherify at $179/month
- Most competitors start at $30-49/month
- **Target:** Find the $29-49/month sweet spot

### 4. Integration Requirements
**Ask:** "What tools do you use to distribute codes? (Email, social media, press kits)"
- Manual distribution = low willingness to pay
- Automated distribution needs = higher value proposition
- **Follow-up:** "Would you want this to integrate with [their tools]?"

## Recommended Pivot Options

### Option A: Developer-Focused Niche
**Position:** "Promo code distribution for app launches across all platforms"
- Target: Indie developers and small studios
- Differentiation: Multi-platform support, developer-friendly UX
- Pricing: $29/month for up to 1000 codes

### Option B: Expand to Gaming
**Research shows:** Mobile gaming rebounded in 2024, strategy games up 83% YoY
- Target: Game developers who need codes for multiple platforms (Steam, mobile, console)
- Higher willingness to pay due to revenue potential
- Integration with game marketing workflows

### Option C: Retreat to Apple Ecosystem
**Position:** Better Apple promo code management (compete with Dev Promo Kit)
- Smaller market but clearer pain point
- Could expand later
- Risk: Limited growth potential

## Red Flags to Listen For

1. **"Apple's system works fine for me"** = Your market might be smaller than expected
2. **"I only need codes once per year"** = Low engagement, hard to monetize
3. **"I just use a spreadsheet"** = Low willingness to pay for solutions
4. **"My marketing team handles this"** = You might be targeting the wrong persona

## Success Signals

1. **"I waste so much time on this"** = Clear pain point
2. **"I've mixed up Android and iOS codes before"** = Multi-platform value confirmed
3. **"I'd pay $X to automate this"** = Pricing validation
4. **"We launch every quarter"** = Recurring revenue potential

## Next Steps After Interviews

**If validation is strong:**
- Build MVP focusing on multi-platform distribution
- Target developer communities (Reddit, Discord, conferences)
- Price at $29-49/month based on feedback

**If validation is weak:**
- Consider pivoting to gaming or broader marketing tools
- Research enterprise developer needs (larger budgets)
- Explore partnership with existing dev tools

## Questions to Add to Your Interview Script

1. "Walk me through your last app launch - how did you handle promo codes?"
2. "What's the most frustrating part of distributing promo codes?"
3. "Have you ever had codes go unused because people couldn't find the right one?"
4. "If you could wave a magic wand, how would promo code distribution work?"
5. "What would convince you to pay for a promo code solution?"

The research suggests there's an opportunity, but it's narrower than initially thought. Your next interviews will determine if it's worth pursuing or if you should pivot to a related but larger market.
