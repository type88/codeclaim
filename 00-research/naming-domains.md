# Domain and Naming Strategy

## Recommended Primary Domain

**CodeClaim.io** - This is the strongest option for several reasons:
- Clear, actionable verb that describes the core user action
- "Claim" implies exclusivity and urgency (codes get claimed, not just "distributed")
- .io extension signals tech/developer focus
- Short, memorable, brandable
- Available for registration

### Backup Options (in priority order)
1. **PromoFlow.dev** - Emphasizes the automated flow, .dev extension for developers
2. **CodeDistro.io** - Direct but slightly less elegant than CodeClaim
3. **AppPromos.co** - Simple, descriptive, shorter .co extension

## Brand Name Strategy

### Primary Brand: CodeClaim
- **Tagline**: "Claim codes, not chaos"
- **Positioning**: The automated promo code distribution platform that just works
- **Voice**: Professional but approachable, developer-focused

### Why "CodeClaim" Works
- **Developer-friendly**: Uses terminology developers understand
- **Action-oriented**: "Claim" is more engaging than "get" or "receive"
- **Differentiating**: Most competitors use generic terms like "voucher" or "coupon"
- **Scalable**: Works for expansion beyond just promo codes

## Domain Portfolio Strategy

### Core Domains to Register
- **CodeClaim.io** (primary)
- **CodeClaim.com** (redirect to .io)
- **CodeClaim.dev** (developer-specific campaigns)

### Defensive Registrations
- **CodeClaims.io** (plural protection)
- **ClaimCodes.io** (reverse protection)

Total investment: ~$150-200 for 2-year registrations

## Competitive Analysis

### What Competitors Are Doing Wrong
- **Vouchery.io**: Too generic, doesn't specify the automation
- **CouponTools.com**: Focuses on "tools" not the outcome
- **Talon.One**: Completely abstract, requires explanation

### Our Advantage
CodeClaim immediately communicates:
1. What it's for (codes)
2. What users do (claim)
3. That it's automated (implied efficiency)

## Technical Considerations

### Email Setup
- **Primary**: hello@codeclaim.io
- **Support**: support@codeclaim.io  
- **No-reply**: codes@codeclaim.io (for automated code delivery)

### Subdomain Strategy
- **app.codeclaim.io** - Main application
- **api.codeclaim.io** - API documentation
- **docs.codeclaim.io** - Documentation site
- **status.codeclaim.io** - Status page

## Social Media Handles

### Priority Platforms
- **Twitter/X**: @codeclaim (likely available)
- **GitHub**: @codeclaim or @codeclaim-io
- **LinkedIn**: CodeClaim (company page)

### Strategy
Secure handles immediately after domain registration. Even if not using initially, prevents squatting.

## Legal Considerations

### Trademark Research
Quick search shows no existing trademarks for "CodeClaim" in software/technology categories. Should conduct formal trademark search before major marketing spend.

### Domain Protection
- Enable domain privacy/WHOIS protection
- Set up auto-renewal
- Use strong registrar (Namecheap, Google Domains, or Cloudflare)

| Defensive domains | $80 | Medium |

## Success Metrics

### 6-Month Goals
- Domain authority score > 20
- Organic search presence for "promo code distribution"
- 50+ developers signed up for early access

### 1-Year Goals  
- Top 3 Google results for "developer promo code platform"
- Recognized brand in developer communities
- 500+ monthly active users

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Don't Register These
- Anything with "voucher" (too retail-focused)
- Generic .com domains that are expensive
- Hyphened versions (codeclaim-io.com)
- Numbers or weird spellings

### Brand Mistakes to Avoid
- Over-explaining the name (let it speak for itself)
- Adding unnecessary taglines everywhere
- Trying to be clever instead of clear
- Copying competitor naming patterns

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Register codeclaim.io today (domains get taken fast)
2. **This week**: Set up basic landing page with email capture
3. **This month**: Create brand guidelines and visual identity
4. **Ongoing**: Monitor mentions and brand usage across platforms

The domain and brand strategy should feel like a natural fit for developers who just want their promo code distribution to work without hassle. CodeClaim delivers that promise in two simple words.
