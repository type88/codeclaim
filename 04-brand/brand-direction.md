# Brand Direction

## Brand Positioning

### Primary Value Proposition
**"Get the right promo code instantly, without the hassle"**

CodeLink positions itself as the first platform specifically designed for developer-to-user promo code distribution. Unlike generic coupon management platforms that focus on retail marketing campaigns, CodeLink solves the unique challenge developers face when launching apps or features: ensuring users get platform-appropriate codes automatically.

### Market Position
- **Category**: Developer Tools / App Distribution
- **Primary differentiator**: Platform-aware automatic code distribution
- **Against competitors**: First-mover in developer-specific promo code distribution (Voucherify, Talon.One target retail/eCommerce)

## Target Audience Profile

### Primary Users: Indie Developers & Small Dev Teams
**Demographics:**
- Individual developers or teams of 2-10 people
- Building mobile apps (iOS/Android) or cross-platform tools

**Pain Points:**
- Managing separate iOS/Android promo code pools manually
- Tracking which codes are used across platforms
- Time spent on distribution logistics instead of development
- Risk of giving wrong platform codes to users

**Behavior:**
- Launch apps 2-4 times per year
- Generate 50-200 promo codes per launch
- Distribute codes via social media, email lists, press outreach
- Use tools like TestFlight, Google Play Console, but lack integrated distribution

### Secondary Users: App Marketing Teams
**Demographics:**
- Marketing coordinators at mobile app companies (10-100 employees)
- Responsible for launch campaigns and user acquisition
- Work with PR agencies and influencers
